Project Overview

This project is built in Power BI and focuses on analyzing app data to extract meaningful patterns and insights. The dataset includes details such as app names, categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and update history. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore app performance, compare different metrics, and identify the factors that influence popularity and user satisfaction.

The analysis covers a range of perspectives – from overall performance trends to category-level insights – making the data easy to interpret for decision-making.

Key Insights Performed

* Top App Analysis – Identified the top 10 apps with the highest ratings and compared their installs and reviews to check whether high ratings also translate into higher engagement.

* Update Trends – Analyzed the frequency of app updates over time and explored whether certain months or seasons show higher update activity.

* Ratings vs. Reviews & Installs – Studied the correlation between ratings, number of reviews, and installs to understand user satisfaction in relation to popularity.

* Category/Genre Analysis – Compared average ratings and engagement across different categories to highlight which genres perform consistently well and which need improvement.

* High vs. Low Performers – Highlighted apps with large install bases but poor ratings, as well as apps with excellent ratings but limited visibility, helping identify growth opportunities.

* Overall Trends – Summarized key business patterns to show how different factors (updates, ratings, installs) collectively impact app success.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase how Power BI can transform raw data into a meaningful story through visualization. By building this dashboard, I aimed to:

Provide a comprehensive view of app performance across multiple dimensions.

Enable easy comparison and filtering using interactive charts and slicers.

Support data-driven decision-making for app developers, businesses, or marketers by highlighting what drives user satisfaction and engagement.
